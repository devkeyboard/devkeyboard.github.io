      'Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!"\n\nWhen the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.\n\n"Don`\'t scream wolf, boy," warned the villagers, "when there is no wolf!" They angrily went back down the hill.\n\nLater, the shepherd boy cried out once again, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.\n\nAs they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, "Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don`\'t cry ‘wolf`\' when there is no wolf!" But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.\n\nLater, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, "Wolf! Wolf!" But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn`\'t come to help.\n\nAt sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn`\'t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.\n\n"There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!`\' but you didn`\'t come," he wailed.\n\nAn old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, "Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!"',

      'There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine.\n\nFor his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus`\' efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.\n\nExcited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.\n\nBut soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn`\'t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.\n\nHungry, Midas groaned, "I`\'ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!"\n\nSeeing his dismay, Midas`\' beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. "The golden touch is no blessing," Midas cried.',

      "One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food. He searched high and low, but couldn`'t find something that he could eat.\n\nFinally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer`'s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he`'d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.\n\nTo reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.\n\nHe tried a few more times but kept failing.\n\nFinally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home. While he walked away, he muttered, \"I`'m sure the grapes were sour anyway.\"",

      'Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was growing next to an ugly cactus.\n\nEvery day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus on his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks.\n\nOne scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.\n\nLooking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer, as friends.',

      'One day, Molly the milkmaid had filled her pails with milk. Her job was to milk the cows, and then bring the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about what to spend her money on.\n\nAs she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the things she wanted to buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a cake and a basket full of fresh strawberries.\n\nA little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, "With the money I get from today, I`\'m going to buy a chicken of my own. That chicken will lay eggs, then I will be able to sell milk and eggs and get more money!"\n\nShe continued, "With more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all the other milkmaids jealous." Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly.\n\nDrenched, Molly said to herself, "Oh no! I will never have enough money to buy a chicken now." She went home with her empty pails.\n\n"Oh, my goodness! What happened to you?" Molly`\'s mother asked.\n\n"I was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about the pails," she answered.\n\n"Oh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, ‘Don`\'t count your chickens until they hatch?`\'"',

      'Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid one golden egg every day. The egg provided enough money for the farmer and his wife to support their daily needs. The farmer and his wife continued to be happy for a long time.\n\nBut, one day, the farmer thought to himself, "Why should we take just one egg a day? Why can`\'t we take them all at once and make a lot of money?" The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly agreed.\n\nThen, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs. But, as he opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood.\n\nThe farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource. As the days went on, the farmer and his wife became poorer and poorer. How jinxed and how foolish they were.',

      'One day, a farmer was looking for a water source for his farm, when he bought a well from his neighbor. The neighbor, however, was cunning. The next day, as the farmer came to draw water from his well, the neighbor refused to let him take any water.\n\nWhen the farmer asked why, the neighbor replied, "I sold you the well, not the water," and walked away. Distraught, the farmer went to the emperor to ask for justice. He explained what had happened.\n\nThe emperor called on Birbal, one of his nine, and wisest, courtiers. Birbal proceeded to question the neighbor, "Why don`\'t you let the farmer take water from the well? You did sell the well to the farmer?"\n\nThe neighbor replied, "Birbal, I did sell the well to the farmer but not the water within it. He has no right to draw water from the well."\n\nBirbal said, "Look, since you sold the well, you have no right to keep the water in the farmer`\'s well. Either you pay rent to the farmer, or take it out immediately." Realizing that his scheme had failed, the neighbor apologized and went home.',

      'A lone elephant walked through the forest, looking for friends. She soon saw a monkey and proceeded to ask, ‘Can we be friends, monkey?`\'\n\nThe monkey quickly replied, ‘You are big and can`\'t swing on trees like I do, so I cannot be your friend.`\'\n\nDefeated, the elephant continued to search when it stumbled across a rabbit. She proceeded to ask him, ‘Can we be friends, rabbit?`\'\n\nThe rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, "You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend."\n\nThen, the elephant continued until she met a frog. She asked, "Will you be my friend, frog?"\n\nThe frog replied, "You are too big and heavy; you cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you can`\'t be my friend."\n\nThe elephant continued to ask the animals she met on her way, but always received the same reply. The following day, the elephant saw all the forest animals run in fear. She stopped a bear to ask what was happening and was told the tiger was attacking all the small animals.\n\nThe elephant wanted to save the other animals, so she went to the tiger and said, "Please, sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them."\n\nThe tiger didn`\'t listen. He merely told the elephant to mind her own business.\n\nSeeing no other way, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared him away. Upon hearing of the brave tale, the other animals agreed, "You are just the right size to be our friend."',

      'Asha was getting frustrated and tired of life, so she asked her father what to do. Her father told her to bring an egg, two tea leaves, and a potato. He then brought out three vessels, filled them with water and placed them on the stove.\n\nOnce the water was boiling, he told Asha to place the items into each pot and keep an eye on them. After 10 minutes, he asked Asha to peel the egg, peel the potato, and strain the leaves. Asha was left confused.\n\nHer father explained, "Each item was placed into the same circumstance, boiling water. See how each responded differently?"\n\nHe continued, "The egg was soft, but is now hard. The potato was hard, but is now soft. And the tea leaves, they changed the water itself."\n\nThe father then asked, "When adversity calls, we respond in the same manner as they have. Now, are you an egg, a potato, or tea leaves?"',
