      "When life is getting you down, and you need a little hope.\nLook deep down inside yourself, and you'll find the way to cope.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, and you need a little love.\nGo to the person whom you are the closest, as the rest they are above.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, and all you need is a laugh.\nFind the friend that makes you smile, they may even be your staff.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, don't allow it so.\nChange the way you think of life, and life will be better, you know.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, don't sit and mope\nTake action and always have hope.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, take time to pray\nDon't allow yourself to frown God will help you see the blessings of the day.",

      'Life is an opportunity, seize the day, live each day to the fullest.\nLife is not a project, but a journey to be enjoyed.\n\nLife is a gift, accept it, enjoy it, and be happy with it.\nLife is a challenge, but challenges can always be overcome.\n\nLife is to be lived, not to be dreamed.\nLife is a wonder, if you sit back and be thankful.\n\nLife is a decision each of us makes, to be happy or sad.\nLife is a time for new beginnings and endings.\n\nLife is a balance, take time for play not just work.\nLife is a joy for those who are optimistic.\n\nLife is a bundle of possibilities if you just look for them.\nLife is a meant to do, not to regret.\nLife is no bed of roses but life is what you make it.',
