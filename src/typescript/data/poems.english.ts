      "When life is getting you down, and you need a little hope.\nLook deep down inside yourself, and you'll find the way to cope.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, and you need a little love.\nGo to the person whom you are the closest, as the rest they are above.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, and all you need is a laugh.\nFind the friend that makes you smile, they may even be your staff.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, don't allow it so.\nChange the way you think of life, and life will be better, you know.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, don't sit and mope\nTake action and always have hope.\n\nWhen life is getting you down, take time to pray\nDon't allow yourself to frown God will help you see the blessings of the day.",
